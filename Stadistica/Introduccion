Hi, my name is Yoav Fruend,

Estudiamos esadistica y probabilidad

common sence

Usando la teoria de probabilidad se puede cal-
cular que tan peque√±a la suma va a ser

So, in probability theory,
we compute probabilities of complex events,
from the underlying base distribution.
Statistics takes us in the opposite direction.
We're given data that was generated
by some Stochastic process, or some random process,

responderemos

which is, suppose you have a hash table
with a million elements,
and you don't want to allow more than five indirections
at most for 10 elements,
so how big does the table need to be?

*the argument is correct,
we need more formalism.
That's the point of this video.
We need concepts like outcome and event,

that if X increases by a standard deviation
then it tells us by how many standard deviations
we expect of Y, we expect Y to increase, okay?
